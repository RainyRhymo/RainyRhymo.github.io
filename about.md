## Hi!
My name is **Ryan Moran**,
but more often than not you'll see me use my web alias, __*Rhymo.*__ I am an aspiring artist and storyteller, and my main interests lie in game design/development.

I've established this blog with a few purposes in mind. I'd like it to act as a portfolio for my art and writing, a devlog for projects I'm working on, and a home for any other creative endeavors I'd like to share. Oh, and I'll probably make more typical informal blog posts every now and then in which I talk about things that have happened to me or general thoughts of mine.
