### Hi!
**My name is Ryan Moran,**
but more often than not you'll see me use my web alias, __*"Rhymo."*

I've created this blog for the purpose of giving me a creative outlet where I can share my ideas with others pretty directly. I'm sure you can relate to the feeling of overflowing with ideas or emotions without a satisfying avenue for expression; it is that feeling precisely which has spurred me to set up this website. 

I am a bit anxious about this project, in part because I don't want to seem presumptuous about the quality or value of my ideas. I'm not putting the stuff I write online because I think it deserves to be read; it is just here in the case that anyone wants to read it. I will work hard to present my ideas in such a way that you may enjoy them or find truth in them, but this is more about expressing myself than it is an attempt to appeal to anyone. 


### What do I write?

A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
