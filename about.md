Hi, my name is Ryan Moran, but more often than not you'll see me use my web alias, "Rhymo."

I've created this blog for the purpose of giving me a creative outlet where I can share my ideas with others pretty directly. I'm sure you can relate to the feeling of overflowing with ideas or emotions without a satisfying avenue for expression; it is that feeling precisely which has spurred me to set up this website. 

I am a bit anxious about this project, in part because I don't want to seem presumptuous about the quality or value of my ideas. I'm not putting the stuff I write online because I think it deserves to be read; it is just here in the case that anyone wants to read it. I will work hard to present my ideas in such a way that you may enjoy them or find truth in them, but this is more about expressing myself than it is an attempt to appeal to anyone. I hope that you will read my content with a critical eye. You may disagree with me (in fact, I'm sure you will at least in a few cases), or you may find my style grating (also almost guarenteed). I ask that you please give me a chance, though, and know that I am always seeking to compound upon my knowledge and to improve.
